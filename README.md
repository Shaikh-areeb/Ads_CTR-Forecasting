# Ad Click-Through Rate (CTR) Forecasting & Optimization  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on forecasting the Click-Through Rate (CTR) for digital advertisements using time-series analysis. By analyzing ad impressions and clicks, we predict engagement trends to help businesses optimize marketing budgets, improve ad targeting, and maximize ROI.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn  
- **Machine Learning:** SARIMA for time-series forecasting  
- **Data Source:** CSV file (ad impressions, clicks, and CTR data)  

## 📊 Business Impact  
- **Optimized Marketing Spend:** Forecasted CTR trends help businesses allocate ad budgets efficiently.  
- **Improved Ad Targeting:** Identifies peak engagement periods for better ad scheduling.  
- **Maximized ROI:** Enables data-driven performance-based bidding strategies.  

## 🔍 Steps Involved  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Loaded the dataset from a CSV file.  
   - Handled missing values and formatted date-time columns.  
   - Created new features such as daily CTR trends.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzed trends in ad impressions, clicks, and CTR.  
   - Visualized engagement patterns using time-series plots.  

3. **CTR Forecasting using SARIMA**  
   - Built and fine-tuned the SARIMA model for accurate CTR predictions.  
   - Evaluated model performance with MAE and RMSE.  

4. **Marketing Optimization Strategies**  
   - Identified high and low engagement periods.  
   - Suggested optimal ad budget allocation based on predicted CTR trends.
