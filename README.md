![](https://github.com/Shaikh-areeb/Ads_CTR-Forecasting/blob/main/insights%20images/forecasting.jpg)

## üìå Project Overview  
This project focuses on forecasting the Click-Through Rate (CTR) for digital advertisements using time-series analysis. By analyzing ad impressions and clicks, we predict engagement trends to help businesses optimize marketing budgets, improve ad targeting, and maximize ROI.  

## Business Context
Click-Through Rate (CTR) is a key performance metric in digital marketing that measures the effectiveness of advertisements. Accurately forecasting CTR helps advertisers optimize their ad placements, budget allocation, and campaign performance. Since CTR exhibits seasonality and trends, time series forecasting models can be used to predict future CTR values and enhance decision-making.

## Objective üéØ
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that forecasts future CTR based on historical data. The model will help marketing teams anticipate changes in CTR, identify trends, and adjust advertising strategies accordingly.

## Task üìÉ

- Analyze the distribution of Clicks and Impressions over time.
- Calculate and visualize the Click-Through Rate (CTR) trend.
- Identify any patterns or trends in CTR based on day-of-week and other features.
- Create relevant features for CTR analysis.
- Build a forecasting model to predict future CTR values.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used  
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn  
- **Machine Learning:** SARIMA for time-series forecasting  
- **Data Source:** CSV file (ad impressions, clicks, and CTR data)  

## üìä Business Impact  
- **Optimized Marketing Spend:** Forecasted CTR trends help businesses allocate ad budgets efficiently.  
- **Improved Ad Targeting:** Identifies peak engagement periods for better ad scheduling.  
- **Maximized ROI:** Enables data-driven performance-based bidding strategies.  

## üîç Steps Involved  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Loaded the dataset from a CSV file.  
   - Handled missing values and formatted date-time columns.  
   - Created new features such as daily CTR trends.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzed trends in ad impressions, clicks, and CTR.  
   - Visualized engagement patterns using time-series plots.  

3. **CTR Forecasting using SARIMA**  
   - Built and fine-tuned the SARIMA model for accurate CTR predictions.  
   - Evaluated model performance with MAE and RMSE.  

4. **Marketing Optimization Strategies**  
   - Identified high and low engagement periods.  
   - Suggested optimal ad budget allocation based on predicted CTR trends.
